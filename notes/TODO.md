**Notes with Ron**

Based on the feedback and information I gathered, I have revised the notes as follows: 
Our project currently involves CafeX Challo, which has consumed a budget of a quarter million dollars. CafeX Challo is an enterprise collaboration software, providing a secure, all-in-one platform for both internal and inter-company communication. It has features such as multi-company sharing, best-in-class security and compliance, and the ability to bridge between collaboration applications like Slack and Microsoft Teams​1​.  

However, we are considering transitioning from CafeX Challo to a system utilizing Tesseract and Samba. The Tesseract component is under the responsibility of Josh, who has already built a functional application that can process PDF files, extract images embedded in them, and convert them to a text variant with metadata for file organization or proper indexing.  

Our system will also incorporate Docker, which we'll use to build a system that can intake files, process them, and output the results. We're still figuring out the specifics, such as whether this will operate on a batch load or on a specific cadence.   

Samba, an open-source software, could be used to provide file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. It would allow us to integrate with existing workflows, possibly serving as the backbone for our file sharing and storage infrastructure.   

There's also the matter of document management. We'll need a drop folder system to consume files into an electronic document management platform. Files on intake (GIF, JPEG, PNG, etc.) will need to be OCR'd to produce a text variant. 

We are also mindful of project timelines and deadlines. Tim is focused on making sure that any dates committed to can be met, acknowledging the repercussions if a date is missed. The team, including Ron, Josh, Colby, and others yet to be determined, is tasked with sorting out these details.  

We still have questions to address and issues to sort out, including the absence of solid requirements and how to prioritize tasks. The project is functional, but there's still a lot of work to be done. We are in the process of reporting progress upstream.


**CurrentProjectPlan**  

 
1. Document Analysis: You have implemented code to extract the metadata from the PDF documents, including any associated metadata that the current library being utilized pulls from

2. Document Indexing: The alphanumeric index has not been created.  

3. Document Searching: The custom search engine has not been implemented, I need some options.

4. Text Extraction: You have set up an OCR system using PyTesseract to extract text from PDFs.

5. File Management: The scripts can open and process individual PDF files. The functionality to download a zip file containing all identified documents is currently not implemented.   

Architecture: The current architecture consists of scripts that perform the backend tasks of extracting text from PDFs, and creating a pandas df with pdf metadata and extracted text that needs to be stored in a database. You might need to transform these scripts into a server-based architecture, design a database schema, and create APIs.   

Reporting: Once the system is operational, you can assess the time and effort required for operation and maintenance. This step has not been done yet.

Finally, based on the project requirements, recent changes, and the utilization of Samba, Matomo, and the transition from Cafe X Challo to another tool, here are the updated status and suggested next steps:


Based on your project's requirements, capabilities, and the recent changes you've shared about the use of Samba, Matomo, and the transition from Cafe X Challo to another tool, here's an updated status and suggested next steps:  

1. **Document Analysis**:  
- The code for extracting metadata from PDF documents is implemented. This includes the document name, as well as creation date,extracted text, author, mod date,producer and document title  

- For security and collaboration, consider using Samba to manage access to these files across your team, especially if members are using different operating systems.   

2. **Document Indexing**:  
- The alphanumeric index has not been created and should be created somehow with insertion into database.

3. **Document Searching**:  
- The custom search engine has not been implemented. 
- The search functionality can be improved by allowing multi-company sharing and collaborating, which was a strength of Cafe X Challo. Looking for a replacement tool that allows similar capabilities could be beneficial.  

4. **Text Extraction**:   
- An OCR system using PyTesseract has been set up to extract text from PDFs. 
- Ensure that the OCR system can handle different types of PDFs, including those with complex layouts or those that include images in addition to text.  





**Remember, the replacement of Cafe X Challo will require some adaptation in your collaboration process. The new tool should ideally provide similar or better capabilities, including secure external and internal collaboration, state-of-the-art security and compliance, and ease of use.**
